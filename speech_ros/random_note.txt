ros2 run speech_ros model_importer
It will gui ask for .zip , folder to copy the model to share directory of package
Link can be provided but link should refer to .zip file
(The model name is gonna be the folder name)

ros2 run speech_ros listener_node model_name:=vosk-small-en-us-...
ros2 launch speech_ros listener_node listener_model_name:=vosk-small-en-us

If there are multiple models found then You should specify model_name argument.
Or  it will stop or choose model automatically?


node can do
self.get_service_names_and_types()

service can
self.srv.srv_name

This might be the answer to know where your service mapped into
